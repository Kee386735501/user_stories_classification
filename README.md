# User Stories Classification

### Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the "User Stories Classification" project, a comprehensive analysis conducted as part of our third-year project requirement. Our research focuses on evaluating the performance of various models in the domain of software requirements classification.

### Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to investigate and compare the effectiveness of different machine learning and neural network models in classifying user stories within software development projects. User stories, a fundamental component of agile methodologies, encapsulate the desired functionalities from an end-user perspective. Accurate classification of these stories is crucial for prioritizing development efforts and ensuring the alignment of software products with user needs.

### Models Evaluated
In our pursuit to understand the most effective approach for classifying user stories, we have employed a variety of models, categorized as follows:

#### Traditional Machine Learning Methods:
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Naive Bayes
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

#### Deep Learning Methods:
1. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)
2. Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa)
3. Text Convolutional Neural Network (TextCNN)

#### Neural Network Methods:
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) combined with BERT for word embedding

### Conclusion
This project aims to shed light on the most effective methodologies for classifying user stories, thereby contributing valuable insights to the field of software requirements analysis. Through the comparative analysis of traditional machine learning, deep learning, and neural network methods, we endeavor to identify the models that provide the highest accuracy and efficiency in classifying user stories.
